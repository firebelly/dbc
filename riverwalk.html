        <p>The theme Designing a Better Chicago acknowledges that our city is constantly evolving: it is never static and it never stops imagining a better version of itself. Likewise, its people are ever on the move. Our approach for this project began by understanding the relevance of this prompt and how Designing a Better Chicago can affect the public experiencing the city.</p>

        <p>Room 6 is an amazing site in the center of Chicago, surrounded by magnificent architecture along the lively and dynamic Riverfront. The question we asked ourselves when given this site was what more can we give to this site as architects? Our design “Give Me a Minute, please!” offers time and space.</p>
        <p>One minute can seem very short, but at the same time one minute can seem very long. A minute is relative. “Give Me a Minute, please!” can be interpreted in many different ways. This phrase often translates as a way to ask someone to wait. It almost always means a short amount of time and not literally a minute. For our society which demands spontaneity, on-the-go, everything-all-at-once, one minute is often broken up and doled out to various competing focuses. What if the city can offer that minute back to you to enjoy?</p>
        <p>The best designed public spaces never dictate or manipulate the visitor to use the space in a certain way. They allow the visitor to explore and discover with time.</p>
        <p>Our installation offers a space for contemplation: a respite - even if knowingly momentary - where visitors will pause, delight, and enjoy their surroundings.</p>
